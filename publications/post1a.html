<p> Process control is a field of engineering that involves the regulation of process variables, while instrumentation is a field of engineering that plays a vital role in ensuring efficient operation of any processing or production plant. It involves the use of a complete set of instruments to measure, indicate, transmit, record and control a process variables. When instruments are properly used, every process equipment operates correctly. </p>

<p><b> Process variables</b> can be defined as certain physical or chemical conditions in a process that we can measure and change, and needs to be controlled in order to achieve desired process results. </p>

<p> An <b>  Instrument</b>  is any device used for measuring, indicating, controlling, recording and adjusting a physical or chemical property in a process. They are the eyes and ears of a process plant. </p>

<p> Instruments used in process plants are usually driven and powered by:         
  
  <ul>
    <li> Air (pneumatic)</li>
    <li> Liquid (hydraulic) </li>
    <li>Electrical power</li>
  </ul>  </p>

  <p> Devices which change one form of energy to another particularly electrical current to pneumatic (I to P converter) in industrial processes are called <b>Transducers</b>. </p>
<p> A <b>  process</b> can be defined as the changing of raw materials into finished products. And it is very important that the process conditions are accurately controlled at all times. These control is achieved with instruments.</p>
<p> A <b> control loop </b> is an active system that keeps a process variable within maximum and minimum values by continuous measurement and corrective actions. </p>

<p>The four major process variables usually being controlled in process plants and systems are: 

    <ul>
        <li> Flow </li>
        <li> Level  </li>
        <li>Pressure </li>
        <li> Temperture </li>
      </ul>   
</p>
<p>The major components of a process control systems are:
    <ul>
        <li> <b> Sensors:</b>  devices that senses signals from the process. It usually converts a physical condition to an electrical signal. </li>
        <li> <b> Transmitters: </b>  devices that standardizes the signals coming from the sensors and gives a standard output usually 4 -20 mA, 0-10V, 3-15 Psi. </li>
        <li> <b> Controllers:</b>  these devices make decisions based on the signals received from the transmitters. </li>
        <li> <b>Final Control Element (Actuators):</b>  devices that convert electrical signals from the controllers into physical conditions. These devices act on the process and cause the achieved control.</li>
      </ul> 


</p>

 
<p> 
    Process signals can either be analog (continuous) signals or digitals (discrete or on/off) signals.  The standard analog signals for instrumentation are: 4-20mA, 0-10V, 3-15Psi. Some of these analog signals don’t start at zero, because controllers often need to know the difference between low signal (minimum value) and no signal (no input at all).  These non-zero low signals are referred to as “Live Zeroes”. </p>
<p> Current loop technologies have been used for analog sensors for decades, to transmit important process data to the control system. In process control, the lowest measurable process value is called the lower range limit (LRL) which represents the 0% reading while the highest measurable process value is called the upper range limit (URL) which represents 100% reading.  </p>

<h7 class="section-heading">Pressure Measurements</h7>
 <br> <br>
<a href="#">

  </a>
  <span class="caption text-muted">A Pressure Transmitter </span>
<p>Pressure (P) is defined as force (F) applied per given area (A).   
    <br>  P = F/A (Pa)  <br>                              
    <br> Pressure generally can be of three types: </p>
 
     <b> Atmospheric Pressure: </b> this is the pressure due to the atmosphere i.e. the pressure of the air around us.  Which varies sometimes with things like weather and altitude.  This pressure is approximately 1.013 Bar or 14.7 Psi 
     <br> <b> Gauge pressure: </b> this is the pressure above that of the surrounding atmosphere. It is the pressure due to an object on a surface.  
     <br> <b> Absolute Pressure:</b>  this is the pressure due to both atmospheric and gauge pressure.  
<br> <br>
     <h7 class="section-heading">Temperature Measurements</h7>
     <br> <br>
    <a href="#">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="img/temp.jpg" alt=""  style= "height:190px; width:210px;"  >
      </a>
      <span class="caption text-muted">Temperature Transmitters </span>

`<p>Temperature can be defined as the degree of hotness or coldness of a place or object.  Temperature transmitters are devices that convert thermal energy to electrical energy. The two (2) major temperature transmitters used in the process industries are: </p>
 <ul>
   <li> <b> Thermocouple: </b> A device that measures temperature using a principle called the “See-beck Effect”. Where two dissimilar metals are joined together to form a hot junction. When this junction is heated, a small EMF is produced that causes current to flow.  To avoid voltage drops, thermocouples use special cables to transmit their signals.  </li>
   <li> <b> RTD (Resistance Temperature Detectors):</b> A device that indicates temperature by measuring the change in electrical resistance of metals as a result of change in temperature. Generally as temperature applied to a metal goes high, the resistance of the metal increases likewise. This change in resistance indicates temperature change.   </li>
 </ul>

 <br> <br>
 <h7 class="section-heading">Level Measuremets</h7>
 <br> <br>
<a href="#">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/level.jpg" alt=""  style= "height:190px; width:270px;"  >
  </a>
  <span class="caption text-muted">A Radar Level Transmitter </span>

  <p> the level measurement for process control are either point measurements - indicating only full or empty states, or continuous measurements – indicating a full range level of a process.   </p>
<p> Some level measuring transmitters include:  
    <ul>
               <li> Ultrasonic transmitters Level  </li>
        <li>Radar transmitters </li>
        <li> Differential pressure transmitters temperture </li>
      </ul>   

   
  </p>

  <br> <br>
  <h7 class="section-heading">Flow Measuremets</h7>
  <br> <br>
 <a href="#">
     <img class="img-fluid" src="img/flow.jpg" alt=""  style= "height:190px; width:310px;"  >
   </a>
   <span class="caption text-muted">A  Flow Transmitter </span>
 
   <p> Flow is one of the most important process variables and it is defined as the movement of fluids (liquid or gas) from one point to another.  In process systems, it is important to know the rate of flow through different process equipment.   <br> There are 2 (two) types of flow:   </p>
 
     <ul>
        <li>  <b>Laminar Flow:</b> this is the flow that occurs when the fluid flow rate is low.  </li>
         <li> <b> Turbulent Flow:  </b> this describes a flow that occurs when flow rate is high.  </li>
       </ul>   
<p> Majorly, flow measurement in process control is usually achieved through the <b> differential pressure principle </b>. </p>
 <p> With the differential pressure princple, a restriction is placed along the flow path of the fluid causing a change in pressure at that point. Pressure downstream of the restriction is usually lower that the pressure upstream of the restriction and the difference between the two pressures is called the differential pressure. These changes in pressure can be used to calculate the flow rate which is usually done by the transmitters.  </p>


         
          <h2 class="section-heading">Benefits of Instrumentation and  Process Control </h2> <br>
          <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/inst.jpg" alt=""  >
            </a>
        

<p>The benefits of instrumentation includes: 

    <ul>
        <li> <b>Instrumentation ensures consistency:</b> 
          Measurements are one of the most important parts in a processing plant. Using the proper process control instrumentation  allows your machines to reduce variability and run to the best of their abilities.
     </li>
        <li>  <b>Proper instrumentation improves quality:</b> 
          Process control systems are central to maintaining product quality. Using proper instrumentation, control systems maintain the proper ratio of ingredients, regulate temperatures and monitor outputs. Without this standard of control, products would vary and quality would be impaired.
          With improved quality comes higher levels of safety since plant safety is a top priority in any operation. </li>

      </ul>

<h2 class="section-heading">The Industrial Process Control Hierarchy </h2> <br>
<a href="#">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/pyrr.jpg" alt=""  >
  </a>
  <span class="caption text-muted"> The Industrial Automation Hierachy </span>

<p>Industrial Automation and process control can be segmented into various hierarchy or levels. With each level having its own designated function. </p>


These levels are:
<p> I. <b> Level 1 (Field level)</b>  – This includes devices such as: sensors, transmitters and actuators (valves, motors and relays). The main task of field level devices is to transfer data from processes through sensors and transmitters, to higher level systems.   </p> 
        
<p> II. <b> Level 2 (Control level) </b>  – This includes the various industrial controllers such as: PLCs, robots and CNC machines. These systems acquire the process parameters from various sensors and then drive the actuators or final control elements based on process signals.    </p> 
        
<p> III. <b> Level 3 (Supervision and Production control level)</b>  – This Includes: SCADA systems, DCS, MES (Manufacturing Execution Systems). In this level, monitoring systems facilitate the controlling and intervening functions such as:

  <ul>
      <li> Setting production targets</li>
      <li> Supervising various parameters Increases  productivity  </li>
      <li> Historical archiving   </li>
</ul>
</p> 

<p> IV. <b> Level 4 (Enterprise and Information Management level) </b>   – This includes: ERP (Enterprise resource planning), PLM (Product life-cycle management), SCM (supply chain management) systems. They are often referred to as top-Floor level systems and they manage the whole automation system and process.   </p>
