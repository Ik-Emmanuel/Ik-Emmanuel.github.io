          <p>The relevance and importance of digital initiatives have shown that they are no longer just good to have, but rather have become critical for survival in emerging economies. The <b> digital revolution  </b>is here, and
             it is changing how financial/ banking services are delivered. Every Financial service provider or bank today should be eager to evolve, using secure and compliant modern technologies to fundamentally re-imagine and re-think their businesses and operations, investing heavily in innovations that could cause real impact.</p>

          <p>We are gradually moving into a new era of digital financial services,
             the evolution of the entire financial service landscape which will result in the emergence of next generation customer experiences: <b> tailor-made, personalised, timely, intelligent services </b>. And the only ones who will deliver differentiating customer service and experience, are those who are able to stay agile, and adapt quickly to rapidily changing demands and requirements. </p>

          
          <h2 class="section-heading"> <b> Improving Financial Services Through Digital Transformation</b></h2> <br>

          <p>
               Digital transformation within the financial space would require total re-designing, and complete re-thinking of entire existing operations. And it involves empowering internal employees with both technological tools, and better skill sets / mindset. <br>
        

            <br> Digital transformation requires not just a change and improvement in an organisation's legacy technology, but an entire transformation of operations, culture and systems. It transforms: <b>people</b> (workforce culture & mode of operations), 
            <b>systems</b> (core banking functions and technological solutions) and <b>operations</b> (customer relationship and brand recognition).<br>


         <br> Financial services today face a myriad of challenges that hinder complete digital transformation, and the delivery of smooth service to their customers.These  challenges include both internal and external challenges. And while some of these challenges can sometimes be out of their control, there are still lots of effective measures that can be put in place to ensure gradual implementation of the needed transformation.

          <ul>
            <br>
            <li> <b> Modernizing Legacy Systems: </b> This requires the upgrading of I.T & technology infrastructure to improve efficiency, and cut down costs. It requires introducing more agile, unified technology and infrastructure to totally transform and improve the way they do business. </li><br>
            <li><b> Intelligent Fraud and Cybercrime Prevention: </b> A lot of banks can agree that cyber risk is one the top threats in the financial service industry. The introduction of digital methods into operations has a potential to open up organisations to new cyber threats and other technology related risks, but with intelligent fraud detecting systems which are able to quickly detect anomalies and prevent these  threats, organisations can mitigate these risks whilst benefiting from these agile digital methods.   </li> <br>
            <li> <b> Cost Effective Regulation Compliance: </b> This involves intelligent risk combating, using smarter and more effective approach to ensure that all operations related  risks are properly monitored and controlled and  there is strict adherence to compliance regulations.   </li> <br>
            <li> <b> Enabling Frictionless Customer Experience: </b> Removing friction from customer journey is one of the most important trends in retail banking, and this can be done through enhanced interaction between associates and customers by improving support with both internal and customer facing capabilities. </li> <br>
            <li> <b> Devising Open Banking Business Models: </b>  If banks and other financial service providers are to really serve customers at the point of all their needs, they would need to be able to expand their offerings as quickly as they can, and leveraging the <b>open banking model</b>  is the way to go. This allows for easy integration of their products and capabilities into a much wider ecosystem.</li>

                      <p>Global digitization is transforming banking, and banking customers now seek more personal or tailored solutions and would happily choose alternatives to traditional banks. <br>
                      
                      Over 80% of bank customers prioritize <b> online and mobile functionality</b> and would gladly switch to providers that provide personalised services.
                  And financial service providers who can deliver on this, increase their net promoter score (NPS)  significantly. </p>

                          <li> <b> Hyper personalised customer experience: </b> unlike the "one size fits all" customer experience of traditional banking, the new banking will be able to deliver personalised customer experiences at scale with speed and agility. </li>
                          <br><li> <b> Customer centric business model: </b> with traditional banking, products and channels are controlled by the bank, enforced by regulation. With the new banking we integrate new technologies with service offerings to meet customers needs and desires with flexibility, and can even go as far as serving their unknown needs. </li>
                          <br> <li> <b> Cost effective regulatory compliance at scale: </b> with traditional banking, we had regulatory compliance through additional workforce. with modern banking, we'll achieve compliance intelligently and more effectively while minimizing cost and impact </li>
                          <br><li> <b> Intelligent predictive security and fraud management: </b> With old traditional banking we had fragmented, reactive, fraud and security practices. With the modern banking we'll leverage predictive technology to combat increasingly sophisticated fraud and criminal activities  </li>
                          <br> <li> <b> Modern architecture: </b> The days of siloed operations, rigid systems with inaccessible data should be gone. Allowing us embrace more agile, open architecture that leverages data with real-time capabilities that enhance the customer experience, enabling an API driven ecosystem that allow for new revenue opportunities  </li>

                      <p>If service providers are to competitively win customers, then they will have to deliver a <b>differentiating customer experience</b>  to not just win customers over, but to effectively retain them and even go as far as turning them into loyal advocates for their brand. </p>
                      <p>Personalised services is the answer to this. Services personal to customers: <b> needs, wants, stage of life, and their environment</b>. And this can only be done by leveraging integrated customer management and advanced analytical capabilities to enable more personalised interactions, offering relevant products and services,
                         and delivering value at every customer touch point. Which will in turn increase customer loyalty and deposits, empowering a more customer-centric client experience.

                          Customizing support to customers' needs in real time and allowing for easy feedback and improvement in the future. </p>
                        <p> <b>Customer touch points</b>  are points of interaction between brands, businesses, and its customers. It is a brand’s point of customer contact, from start to finish.

    The Bank of the future will be a lot more agile and responsive to customers’ personal needs. Providing a single experience for customers through a unified interface, creating a seamless end-to-end journey to the desired customer outcome.
    
 <br> It is to transform from being merely <b>traditional</b>   (providing services through sepa  rate multiple channels ), to becoming more  <b>intelligent</b>  (able to seamlessly predict what's next for the customer), and then finally transition into becoming able to provide <b> fully immersive experiences </b> (frictionless consistent customer experiences)
